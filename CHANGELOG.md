--------------------------------------------------------------

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Three authentication methods**: Support for API Key, JWT Token, and Username/Password authentication — choose the method that fits your setup
- **JWT Token support**: Use pre-existing JWT tokens from browser-based logins (OIDC, GitHub, Google OAuth) to authenticate without storing credentials
- **Automatic connection on startup**: When credentials are configured via environment variables or config file, the server connects to Komodo automatically at launch — no manual `komodo_configure` call needed
- **Connection monitoring with auto-reconnect**: Periodic health checks detect connection loss and automatically re-establish the connection with exponential backoff
- **Login method discovery**: The `komodo_configure` tool queries available login methods (local, GitHub, Google, OIDC) from the Komodo server and displays them for informational purposes
- **Auth rejection detection**: Authentication failures (invalid credentials, expired tokens, unknown users) are clearly distinguished from network errors and reported with actionable messages
- **Error extraction utilities**: Komodo API errors are parsed and formatted into human-readable messages with proper error classification

### Changed

- **Connection architecture**: Unified connection management — a single `KomodoConnection` class handles client lifecycle, authentication, health monitoring, and reconnect logic
- **Configure tool**: Richer feedback on connection status including Komodo version, health check results, and available login methods
- **Health check tool**: Reports detailed connection state including server version, MCP server version, and clear status indicators
- **Credential configuration**: Support for Docker secrets (`*_FILE` env vars), config file (`[komodo]` section), and direct environment variables with clear priority chain
- **Environment variable naming**: `KOMODO_JWT_TOKEN` (was `KOMODO_JWT_SECRET`) — clearly identifies the value as a token, not a signing key
- **Validation error handling**: Invalid tool inputs (e.g. multiple auth methods) return clean MCP error responses with server-side warning logs instead of unhandled exceptions

### Removed

- Framework's `ConnectionStateManager` dependency — connection management is now fully self-contained

### Dependencies

- Updated `mcp-server-framework` to v2.0.0 (`ReadinessConfig` replaces removed `HealthConfig`)

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.0] - Framework Integration & Config Improvements

### Fixed

- **Tool error messages**: `requireClient()` now throws state-aware error messages instead of the tool name. When Komodo is not configured, the error clearly says "Komodo client is not configured. Use komodo_configure to set up connection." For connection failures: "Komodo client is not connected. Check configuration and connectivity."

### Changed

- **Transport fully config-driven**: Removed programmatic `resolveTransport()` — transport mode, host, and port are now resolved entirely from the framework config cascade (env schema defaults → `.env` → config file → env vars). No application-level transport resolution needed
- **Interpolation from framework**: Replaced local `interpolate()` utility with the framework's exported `interpolate()` and `MessageParams` type from `mcp-server-framework`, removing code duplication

### Dependencies

- Updated `mcp-server-framework` with OTEL connection error handling, TextFormatter defaults fix, and DiagLogLevel improvements

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.2.2] - Docker Security & Build Optimization

### 🔐 Security

- **Hardened Runtime User**: Use built-in `node` user (UID 1000) with `/sbin/nologin` shell
  - No interactive login possible for the service account
  - Replaces custom `komodo` user for better security alignment with base image
- **Immutable Build Artifacts**: Build files owned by `root:root`, runtime user cannot modify them
  - `node_modules/` and `build/` are read-only for the application
- **Tini Init System**: Added [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) as PID 1 for proper signal handling
  - Ensures graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
  - Prevents zombie processes
- **Signed Git Tags**: Release tags are now cryptographically signed via GitHub API
  - Annotated tags with release notes for better traceability

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v6 Support**: Added 32-bit ARMv6 architecture (Raspberry Pi Zero/1)
  - Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm/v6`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Healthcheck: curl → wget**: Replaced `curl` with `wget --spider` for healthchecks
  - `wget` is included in Alpine (BusyBox) - no additional package installation needed
  - `--spider` performs HEAD request only (more efficient)
- **Optimized Docker Build**: Reduced unnecessary steps and improved layer caching
  - Copy only `src/` and `tsconfig*.json` instead of entire context
  - Removed `curl` dependency from production stage
  - Combined multiple `LABEL` statements into one
- **Build Metadata**: Embedded VERSION, BUILD_DATE, and COMMIT_SHA into container
  - Files available at `/app/build/VERSION`, `/app/build/BUILD_DATE`, `/app/build/COMMIT_SHA`
  - OCI labels include version, created date, and revision
- **GHCR Metadata Fix**: Added `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: manifest,index` to CI
  - Fixes missing description in GitHub Container Registry for multi-arch images
- **Release Workflow Cleanup**: Removed separate attestation images from GHCR
  - Provenance and SBOM are now embedded directly in image manifest
  - Cleaner registry without `sha-*` tagged attestation artifacts

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CI Annotations**: Multi-arch images now correctly display metadata in GHCR package page
- **OpenSSF Signed-Releases**: Export SLSA attestations as GitHub Release assets
  - Enables OpenSSF Scorecard to verify signed releases
  - Attestations available as `attestations.intoto.jsonl` in each release

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: 1.25.2 → 1.26.0
- `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`: 0.68.0 → 0.69.0
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`: 0.210.0 → 0.211.0

- `hono`: 4.11.4 → 4.11.7

--------------------------------------------------------------
## [1.2.1] - Minojr Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Docker ARM64 Build**: Fixed QEMU emulation failure during ARM64 cross-compilation
  - Moved `npm prune --omit=dev` to builder stage to avoid running npm in production stage under QEMU
  - Production stage now copies pre-pruned `node_modules` from builder instead of running `npm ci`
  - Resolves "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" error on ARM64 builds

- **Version Resolution in Docker**: Fixed server failing to start with "Server version is required" error
  - Version is now baked into `build/VERSION` during Docker build from `package.json`
  - Single Source of Truth: `package.json` → immutable once image is built
  - Fallback chain: `build/VERSION` → `npm_package_version` → `package.json`

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v7 Support**: Added 32-bit ARM architecture support (Raspberry Pi 3, older ARM devices)
- Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Improved multi-stage build with better documentation and layer caching
- **Build Performance**: Production stage no longer runs npm operations, reducing build time and complexity
- **Removed VERSION Build-Arg**: Version is now extracted from `package.json` during build, not passed as argument

--------------------------------------------------------------
