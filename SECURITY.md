# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email **[security@my-domain.org]** instead of using the issue tracker.

I'll respond within 72 hours.

## Supported Versions

I release security updates for the latest version only. Please keep your installation up to date.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit credentials or `.env` files
- Use dedicated Komodo users with minimal permissions
- Run containers as non-root (default in our setup)
- Use HTTPS for Komodo connections
