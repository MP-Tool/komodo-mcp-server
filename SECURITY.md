# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not report it in the public issue tracker.

Instead, please use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting**:
1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the details to privately disclose the issue to the maintainers.

If this feature is not available, you can reach out via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/discussions) to request a private communication channel.

I'll respond as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions

I release security updates for the latest version (main branch) only. Please keep your installation up to date.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit credentials or `.env` files
- Use dedicated Komodo users with minimal permissions
- Run containers as non-root (default in our setup)
- Use HTTPS for Komodo connections
